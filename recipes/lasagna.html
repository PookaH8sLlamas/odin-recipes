        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>Lasagna, a cornerstone of Italian cuisine, is a layered baked pasta dish that harmoniously blends textures and flavors. Its foundation lies in wide, flat pasta sheets, <strong>traditionally made from durum wheat semolina</strong>, though egg-enriched versions exist. These sheets are layered with a rich sauce, most notably ragù, a slow-cooked meat sauce featuring ground beef or pork, simmered with tomatoes, onions, celery, and carrots. A simpler tomato sauce may also be used. Creaminess is introduced through béchamel, a velvety white sauce made from a roux of butter and flour, and milk. Cheeses play a vital role, with ricotta providing a soft, slightly sweet counterpoint, mozzarella offering a gooey, melted texture, and Parmesan adding a sharp, salty, and nutty finish. The assembly follows a <em>precise sequence</em>: a base of sauce, pasta sheets, ragù or tomato sauce, ricotta, and béchamel, repeated multiple times, culminating in a top layer generously coated with mozzarella and Parmesan. Baked until golden and bubbly, lasagna transforms into a comforting, satisfying meal. Regional variations abound, from Neapolitan lasagna with meatballs and hard-boiled eggs to vegetarian versions packed with colorful vegetables and seafood lasagnas featuring shrimp and scallops. This iconic dish, with its ancient roots and enduring popularity, exemplifies the art of Italian comfort food.</p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <p><ul>
            <li>Flat Pasta Sheets</li>
            <li>Savory Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Ground Meat of your choice</li>
            <li>Diced Onions</li>
            <li>Diced Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
            <li>Grated Cheese</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

        <p><ol>
            <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great <em>depth</em> of flavor.</li>
            <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan—like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great <strong>flavor!</strong></li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
