        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>A brownie is a baked confection, typically rectangular or square, that falls somewhere on the spectrum between a cake and a cookie. Its defining characteristic is its dense, fudgy, or sometimes cakey texture, often achieved through a high proportion of chocolate and butter in the batter. Brownies commonly incorporate ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract, with variations including additions like nuts, chocolate chips, or swirls of caramel or cream cheese. They can range from intensely rich and chewy to light and airy, depending on the recipe and baking time. Essentially, a brownie offers a concentrated dose of chocolatey sweetness in a satisfyingly compact form.</p>

        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

        <p><ol>
            <li>To create classic fudgy brownies, begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and preparing an 8x8 or 9x9 inch baking pan by greasing it and lining it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over low heat, melt half a cup of unsalted butter, then remove it from the heat and stir in one cup of granulated sugar until well combined. Allow the mixture to cool slightly before adding two large eggs, one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition, followed by one teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together half a cup of all-purpose flour, one-third cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined, being careful not to overmix. If desired, stir in half a cup of chocolate chips and half a cup of chopped nuts.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper and cutting them into squares for serving.</li>
