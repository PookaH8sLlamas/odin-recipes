        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>A taco is a beloved and versatile dish originating from Mexico, characterized by its simple yet adaptable construction. At its core, a taco consists of a tortilla, which serves as the edible vessel for a variety of fillings. This tortilla can be made from corn or wheat, with corn tortillas being the traditional choice, offering a slightly earthy and chewy texture. Wheat tortillas, on the other hand, tend to be larger and softer.</p>

        <p>The true magic of a taco lies in its fillings. These can range from simple to elaborate, showcasing the vast diversity of Mexican cuisine. Common fillings include various types of seasoned meats, such as carne asada (grilled steak), al pastor (marinated pork), carnitas (braised pork), and pollo (chicken). Vegetarian options abound, with fillings like beans, mushrooms, and roasted vegetables gaining popularity. Seafood tacos, featuring ingredients like shrimp or fish, are also a delightful variation.</p>
            
        <p>Beyond the protein or vegetable base, tacos are typically adorned with an array of toppings that add layers of flavor and texture. Diced onions and fresh cilantro are classic additions, providing a sharp and herbaceous contrast to the rich fillings.</p>
            
        <p>Salsas, ranging from mild to fiery, are essential for adding a kick of heat and a burst of freshness. Other common toppings include shredded lettuce or cabbage, crumbled queso fresco (a fresh, crumbly cheese), sour cream or crema, and a squeeze of lime juice, which brightens the overall flavor profile. The combination of a warm tortilla, flavorful filling, and vibrant toppings creates a harmonious and satisfying culinary experience.</p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

        <p><ol>
            <li>A classic taco begins with a foundation of either a corn or wheat tortilla, warmed to pliable perfection. The filling typically centers around a protein, such as seasoned ground beef, chicken, or pork, cooked with spices like chili powder, cumin, and garlic.</li>
            <li>To assemble, warm the tortillas on a griddle or in a pan until soft and slightly toasted. Then, spoon the cooked protein into the center of each tortilla.</li>
            <li>Next, add a layer of fresh toppings: diced white onion and chopped cilantro provide a crisp, aromatic contrast, while shredded lettuce or cabbage adds a refreshing crunch. A dollop of salsa, ranging from mild pico de gallo to fiery habanero, introduces a burst of flavor and heat.</li>
            <li>Crumbled queso fresco or a drizzle of sour cream or Mexican crema contributes a creamy, tangy element.</li>
            <li>Finally, a squeeze of fresh lime juice brightens the entire taco, balancing the richness of the meat and the spiciness of the salsa. The tortilla is then folded in half, ready to be enjoyed. Variations are endless, allowing for substitutions and additions based on personal preference.</li>
